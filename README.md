# Minesweeper Solver

This project is a Python-based automation tool for solving Minesweeper in Dota 2. It supports different screen resolutions and provides multiple difficulty levels for the solver.

## Features:
- **Screen Resolution Support**: FullHD, 2K
- **Languages**: Python
- **Dependencies**: Install required Python libraries

## Prerequisites:
1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install required libraries
3. **Display Settings in Dota 2**:
   - Set Dota 2 to **Borderless Window Mode**.
   - Change the resolution to **FullHD** (1920x1080).

## How to Run:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to execute the Minesweeper solver:
    ```bash
    python minesweeper_solver.py <level>
    ```
    Replace `<level>` with a difficulty level from 1 to 5.

3. After running the script, make sure Dota 2 is the active window (on top).
4. Ensure the **Minesweeper board** is **fully visible** and not covered by any other window.

## Notes:
- The script requires Dota 2 to be in **FullHD** resolution to function properly.
- Ensure that the game is running before starting the solver.
